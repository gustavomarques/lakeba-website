						<p>Shelfie is just one example of Lakeba’s innovative strides into software. It’s a cloud-based data analytics platform that automatically analyses retail shelves and recognizes any gaps in products, providing actionable data that maximizes proﬁtability, improves performance and drives revenue.</p>

						<p>Shelfie has been revolutionary, and it’s currently been deployed across half a dozen major retail chains in the UK, Europe, the US and Australia. The solution is a world first, as evidenced by the adoption of these global retailers.  The solution is embedded with AI, and the software has been from the ground up, partnering with the hardware camera provider AXIS and the Zebra scanning solution.</p>

The 360DGREES platform helps organisations create MR training with an interactive layer to connect people to the content and enables organisations to gamify training. The gamification lifts participation rates from 5-10% to 100% - because it’s hard to be distracted when you are immersed and interacting in a world of action and activity!</p>

						<p>BAF is a blockchain development that allows any bank to verify in real time that specific documents, like pay slips or tax returns, have been issued by the right source and with the numbers presented by the borrower. This single ledger, decentralised way of capturing information offers significant benefits and is a powerfully transparent way of delivering that much needed single source of truth.</p>

						<p>We have recently completed a major pilot in one of Australia’s leading banks, which saw the bank use 100,000 existing pay slips and more than 1000 historical car and home loans, with 100% of validation proved. This is a powerful solution and one that we believe more banks will be adopting as we start to roll out the BAF solution across the broader banking and finance industry, not just in Australia but globally.</p>

						<p>BAF is a blockchain development that allows any bank to verify in real time that specific documents, like pay slips or tax returns, have been issued by the right source and with the numbers presented by the borrower. This single ledger, decentralised way of capturing information offers significant benefits and is a powerfully transparent way of delivering that much needed single source of truth.</p>

						<p>We have recently completed a major pilot in one of Australia’s leading banks, which saw the bank use 100,000 existing pay slips and more than 1000 historical car and home loans, with 100% of validation proved. This is a powerful solution and one that we believe more banks will be adopting as we start to roll out the BAF solution across the broader banking and finance industry, not just in Australia but globally.</p>
